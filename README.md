# sbi-for-connectomics

This repository contains research code and figures of the "SBI for connectomics" paper (link to paper). 

It is based on a small python package called `consbi` that allows to simulate different wiring rules in the structural model of the rat barrel cortex. 
Additionally, it contains jupyter notebooks contains `tutorials` and code for reproducing the `figures` shown in the paper.
