# sbi-for-connectomics

This repository contains research code and figures of the "SBI for connectomics" paper (link to paper). 
It contains a small python package called `consbi` that allows to simulate different wiring rules in the structural model of the rat barrel cortex (see paper for details). 

The repository for running SBI including detailed tutorials is located at https://github.com/mackelab/sbi. 

Please reach out and create an issue if you have any questions or encounter problems with using this repository.

## Content
The `tutorials` folder contains three notebooks showing how to `simulate` connectomics data, how to use SBI to `infer` parameters, and how to `analyze` (TODO) the resulting posteriors.

The `figures` folder contains notebooks for reproducing all figures presented in the main text of the paper.

The `data` and `results` folders contain binary files saved via `git-lfs` (see below).

## Binary files are provided via `git-lfs`
